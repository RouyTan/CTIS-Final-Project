This is a math game meant for elementary aged children. 

The Main class 
    In the Main class the JFrame is initialized. All the JPanels are also added onto the JFrame. 
    I also initialized a random generator that would produce random numbers for the math problems. 
    I included value bounds on the random number and limited the number of decimals the values have 
        (2 decimals for addition and subtraction; 0 decimals for division) 
    I also made code that produced the answers for these equations

Panel Classes
    I made 4 classes that extends the JPanels. One JPanel for each operation.
